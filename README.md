# 50.035-Computer-Vision-Project
A multiclass, multilabel classification problem for 50.035 project

## packages required
- Numpy, tensorflow

## What is this?
This project involves a multiclass, multilabel classification problem of different type of foliar (fungi) diseases
affecting apple orchards. The project is adapated from the annual Plant Pathology FGCV8 competition where we used
the 2021 version's dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8

## What did we do?
- Tested and tried multiple model architectures to achieve highest performance of accuracy across 6 classes
- Trained network from scratch instead of pretrained weights for better accuracy to our dataset.

## How to run a model:
- Include the folders for _actual_test_images,test_images and train_images_ in the same directory as a specified notebook
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Run all cells
